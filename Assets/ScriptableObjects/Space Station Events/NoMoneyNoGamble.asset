  descriptionText: "Place as many leverage tokens as you would like to bet off to
    the side, then gamble. Gamble: Roll a D10, then choose an opponent to roll a
    D10. Whoever rolls the highest wins the gamble (tie goes to the opponent). If
    you lose, your bet goes back to the box\u2019s token pool. If you win, you receive
    as many tokens as you bet from the box\u2019s token pool and take your bet back.
    Furthermore, if you win with a roll of 9 or 10, then you gain the \u201CTreasure
    Map\u201D card (in addition to leverage) from the Assets and Misfortunes deck."
