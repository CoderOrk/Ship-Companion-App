  descriptionText: If you refuse, move on. If you accept, then you must pay 1 leverage
    token and gain one of the Mercenary Ship cards in the Assets and Misfortunes
    deck. Take out all Mercenary cards from the deck and choose one of them at random.
    Place the figure for this Mercenary Ship on a space that is adjacent to the space
    station. Also place the Mercenary Ship stat card into your card pool. This ship
    costs 1 leverage token (already paid for this turn). The Mercenary Ship (hired
    gun) will also be able to activate this round. The hired gun for all intents
    and purposes will be treated like any of your other ships in relation to the
    rules. If the hired gun ship is destroyed or you can no longer pay the 1 token
    price per turn, then this ship must be removed from the game.
