  descriptionText: "The opponent to your left must randomly choose a card from the
    \u201CMercenary\u201D ships. They must then place that ship\u2019s corresponding
    figure on any adjacent space to your ship. They must use that ship for the purpose
    of fighting your ship (only) to the death. Your opponent will activate the mercenary
    ship as though it is one of their own during their turn. They will also make
    all appropriate decisions and rolls for this ship when needed. The ship will
    be discarded after it or your ship has been destroyed."
